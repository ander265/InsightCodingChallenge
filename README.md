This is a submission for the Data Engineering program starting in March 2019. 

# The Problem
Imagine you are a data engineer working for an online pharmacy. You are asked to generate a list of all drugs, the total number of UNIQUE individuals who prescribed the medication, and the total drug cost, which must be listed in descending order based on the total drug cost and if there is a tie, drug name in ascending order.

# The Solution
The work was done using Python, without external packages such as PANDAS.
